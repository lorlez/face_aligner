# Face Aligner
A python script I used for my timelapse project.<br/>
<br/>
The project consists in taking a picture of your face everyday for a long period of time.<br/>
Editing those pictures in sequence in a video shows how time changes your facial features, the environment and people around you.<br/>
<br/>
This script aligns those images based on the facial features it detects and outputs the timelapse as a video file.<br/>
All the instructions to setup the script are commented inside it. Have fun!<br/>
