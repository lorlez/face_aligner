# Face Aligner
A python script I used for my timelapse project.<br/>
<br/>
The project consists in taking a picture of your face everyday for a long period of time and to edit those pictures in sequence in a video.<br/>
The aim of the video is to show how time changes your facial features, the environment and people around you.<br/>
All the instructions to setup the script are written in comments inside it. Have fun!<br/>
